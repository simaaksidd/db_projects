# Database Systems 

Welcome to the Database Systems repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of materials covering a semester-long exploration of databases and data systems. I worked on this project with the help of my partner [Edward Kim](https://github.com/Drawnard1)
## Course Overview

### Themes

The course is organized into three broad themes:

1. **Query Languages**
   - Emphasis on SQL
   - Topics include `SELECT-FROM-WHERE`, `ORDER-BYs`, `JOINS`, `INSERTs`, `UPDATEs`, `DELETEs`, aggregates, group-bys, and subqueries.

2. **Data Models**
   - Exploration of various data models, including relational, document, graph, and hybrid models.

3. **Data Engineering**
   - Focus on data cleansing, exploration, and analysis.
   - Topics include data ingestion, integration, and visualization.

### Technologies Used

Throughout the course, we worked with a variety of database technologies and data science tools on the Google Cloud Platform. The tools and platforms include:
- MySQL
- Postgres
- BigQuery
- Firestore
- MongoDB
- Neo4j
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Looker Studio
- Trino

## Projects

We had hands-on experience constructing multiple databases for both operational and analytical purposes. The projects will involve working with different database technologies and data science tools to implement concepts learned during the course.
